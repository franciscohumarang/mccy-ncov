## OurHeroesSG by GoodHood
![OurHeroes.SG](/images/OurHeroes.png)

**[OurHeroes.SG](https://heroes.goodhood.sg/heroes)** is a ground up movement that encourages everyone to appreciate the unsung heroes during this time of crisis (bus captains, supermarket staff, nurses, etc.)!

Simply create a post and #OurHeroesSG on FB (set privacy setting to public) or Instagram, and we'll compile them to a digital appreciation wall at http://heroes.goodhood.sg, where every week for 4 weeks, 20 heroes will receive a $10 FairPrice voucher (courtesy of @NTUC Social Enterprises)

The initiative is by **[GoodHood.SG](https://goodhood.sg/)**.
