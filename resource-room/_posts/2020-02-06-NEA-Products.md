# Interim List of Household Products and Active Ingredients for Disinfection of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
_Released on 4 February 2020_

Many general household products contain the appropriate concentrations of active ingredients (A.I.) that are known to inactivate coronaviruses. For general precautionary cleaning, detergent and water are adequate. For disinfection of areas that are very likely to be contaminated with nCoV (e.g. bedroom of a person confirmed to have a CoV infection), disinfectant/cleaning products listed in Table 1 can be used.  The product list is based on currently available data and active ingredients known to be effective against coronaviruses (Table 2). Both tables will be updated as data from more products are gathered, and as more products are assessed to be appropriate.

In addition to the use of cleaning agents, other treatments effective against coronavirus include steam and heat treatment.
